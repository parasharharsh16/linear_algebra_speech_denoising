# Audio Denoising using STFT and Linear Filters

## Description
This project focuses on denoising audio signals using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and linear filtering techniques. It implements methods for adding noise to clean audio, applying adaptive filtering, and evaluating the performance of the denoised audio.

## Project Setup and Usage Steps
### Installation
To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: ```git clone git@github.com:parasharharsh16/linear_algebra_speech_denoising.git ```
2. Navigate into the project directory: ```cd linear_algebra_speech_denoising```
3. Create a conda (use Miniconda or Anaconda) environment: ```conda create --prefix ./.venv python=3.9```
4. Activate the conda environment: ```conda activate ./.venv```
5. Install the required dependencies: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Prepare Dataset
The dataset is already included in the repository in the `data` folder, which contains:
- **clean audio**: Folder with clean audio files.
- **noise audio**: Folder with noise audio files.

When the code is executed, it automatically creates noisy input by mixing the clean and noise audio files and stores them in a folder called `noisyaudio`.

### Run the Code
1. Adjust the parameters in `settings.py` according to your needs.
2. Run the main script: `python main.py`

### Results
- The `output/denoisedaudio` folder contains generated denoised audio files.
- The `output/plots` folder contains plots comparing cleay, noisy and denoised waveforms. 

## Evaluation Metrics
The project evaluates the quality of the denoised audio using:
- **SNR**: Signal-to-Noise Ratio.
- **PESQ**: Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality.
- **STOI**: Short-Time Objective Intelligibility.
- **MSE**: Mean Squared Error.
- **PSNR**: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio.

## Results Interpretation

- **SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio):** The average SNR of the noisy audio is about **3.33 dB**. After denoising, it drops to **-31.90 dB**, indicating that while noise is present, the cleaning process did not significantly improve the signal quality.

- **PESQ (Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality):** The average PESQ score decreased from **1.57** in the noisy audio to **1.41** in the cleaned audio. This suggests that while there was a slight improvement in quality, some distortion remains noticeable.

- **STOI (Short-Time Objective Intelligibility):** The average STOI score changed slightly from **0.86** to **0.85**, indicating that some speech clarity was preserved despite the noise.

- **MSE (Mean Squared Error):** The MSE increased from **1026.50** for the noisy audio to **3629855.38** for the denoised audio, suggesting that the denoising process introduced significant errors.

- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio):** The average PSNR dropped from **54.32 dB** to **19.09 dB**. This implies that while some noise was removed, the cleaning process may have introduced new issues that affected the overall audio quality.
